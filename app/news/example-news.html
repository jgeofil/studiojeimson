This September Studio Jeimson moved to Canada! Yes!!<br>
After a year of working closely together with CONTRA and SEKOIA, my first shows as a VJ, two awesome
projects for the Warehouse Elementenstraat, and last but definitely not least: the first time I publicly presented
my research.. A new opportunity presented itself. It was a no brainer.<br>
<br>
It's been super interesting to learn about this country and it's cultural scene. Not knowing what to expect
I've settled and started to explore possibilities for interesting projects and potential collaborations.<br>
So far I've gotten acquainted with le Société des Arts Technologiques and the Phi Centre.
Le Salon Daomé, Stereo Nightclub, Le Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal and of course the city's beautiful streets.
<br>
Having come here without any expectations turned out so great. New adventures await!<b>

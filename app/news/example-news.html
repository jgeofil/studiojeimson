Since I've started VJing mid 2014 (initially to expand SEKOIA's visual identity with a live performance) I've been thinking a lot about what I would want my sets to be like. I like to see this as an ongoing study.
Where initially I approached the platform from a branding perspective.. more and more I'm beginning to see possibilities for a cross-over that could show my love for contemporary visual culture and it's networked images while supporting DJ sets and contributing to the visual atmosphere of a room.

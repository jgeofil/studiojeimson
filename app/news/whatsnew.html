In March 2016 I've applied as a research fellow at Het Nieuwe Instituut (Rotterdam). Taking as a departure point
the centennial anniversary of the Russian Revolution, Het Nieuwe Instituut’s 2017 program will explore
revolution, reflecting on radical movements of the 20th century while also investigating the unstable landscape of the
present and the unpredictable territories of the future.<br>
Within its annual theme I wish to further my research, deploying different media to develop it's visual
identity, physical or digital form and messages. And to explore visual languages that can effectively
communicate the urgent as well as trivial, the mainstream as well as the niche and the prosaic as well as the
poetic parts of all the projects subject matter. Fingers crossed!

Since I've been away from the club screen for a bit I've had plenty of time to explore new ways of adding
interactivity to my VJ sets and new ways of creating footage. I've started developing custom hardware to get
some live sync corruption and edge feedback going. As my archive is growing I'm getting more and more
excited to get back into it back home in Holland.<br>
<br>
More tests real soon!

After an intimate closing party with friends and family in Amsterdam last Friday, it’s time to salute you and
everyone else that has been following us online. A sign of gratitude. One last present. Our musical testament.<br>
<br>
As a final endeavour, we asked all SEKOIA team members to select 5 tracks that have stuck with them through
the years. Tunes that fully embody the SEKOIA sound, songs with special stories and music that would directly
take them back to special moments experienced in the last four years.<br>
<br>
During a rainy January afternoon, Will Oirson, Florinsz Janvier and Vela Uniform got together in the studio
and mixed all these tracks into one, massive 5 hour recording. Our final podcast and our last gift to you. Lots of
recognisable tracks, a collection of classics. Songs that will stick with us for the rest of our lives. A podcast
with different chapters. There’s something in here for everyone. Please enjoy it as much as we did creating it!<br>

Fascinated by online visual culture and user generated content, Jeisson Drenth has been studying how the
democratisation of production influences the way internet users create and spread media content online.<br>
This ongoing study focuses firstly on how the internet has changed from a static, top-down medium to a global
phenomenon that enables people to get in touch with each other through network connection on multiple social
platforms for countless reasons. Secondly it examines the impact that the new endless stream of online
(moving) images has on visual culture in general.<br>
<br>
To step away from the traditional format of the article, the study has set out to draw inspiration from a new type
of research and different media. In a series of short interviews 'Online for real' explores how young adults that
went online for the first time during their teens engage with others on the world wide web. What social
platforms do they use and how do they present themselves online? When they 'share' do they produce, select,
maybe even curate? Do they use network connection to engage intimate relationships and if so, what are they
willing to share and what not?<br>

2015 has been absolutely awesome. Highlights with SEKOIA: playing at Together Boston and Best Kept Secret
Festival. Infinite Scroll Apocalpyse, my lecture at the First of August Academy. Working with the Warehouse
Elementstraat, CONTRA, Blijdorp Festival and BAR Rotterdam. Experimenting with club screens and further developing
my research. I've met great people. Worked my ass off. It all went by so fast.<br>
<br>
From september I'll be relocating to Canada to focus on continuing my research and developing my VJ set.<br>
The first year working as Studio Jeimson has shown me it's so valuable to create space for long term projects.
I've set out to find new inspiration and perspectives. A new adventure awaits! ★★

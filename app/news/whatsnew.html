In March 2016 I've applied as a research fellow at Het Nieuwe Instituut (Rotterdam). Taking as a departure point
the centennial anniversary of the Russian Revolution, Het Nieuwe Instituutâ€™s 2017 program will explore
revolution, reflecting on radical movements of the 20th century while also investigating the unstable landscape of the
present and the unpredictable territories of the future.<br>
Within its annual theme I wish to further my research, deploying different media to develop it's visual
identity, physical or digital form and messages. And to explore visual languages that can effectively
communicate the urgent as well as trivial, the mainstream as well as the niche and the prosaic as well as the
poetic parts of all the projects subject matter. Fingers crossed!

Since I've been away from the club screen for a bit I've had plenty of time to explore new ways of adding
interactivity to my VJ sets and new ways of creating footage. I've started developing custom hardware to get
some live sync corruption and edge feedback going. As my archive is growing I'm getting more and more
excited to get back into it back home in Holland.<br>
<br>
More tests real soon!

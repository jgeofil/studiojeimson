In April 2015 I contributed as a speaker at the First of August Academy night
hosted by the SSBA Salon (Amsterdam City Theatre). The research I presented at
this event is an ongoing project that focusses on the development of visual
culture within the context of social platforms and user generated content.
<br>Where the first part of this lecture explains what technical developments have facilitated and stimulated the rise of online communities, the second part goes into how the market and the internet user itself shape their new online territories.<br>
The presentation of my research is a call for critical analysis of the democratization of media production and how it shapes the world around us be it online or offline.

FoA. Academy is a platform for young researchers to share their research in the
field of fashion and socio-cultural trends with an audience. In a very
approachable way, FoA. Academy shifts to a more in-depth analysis of fashion, style and
trends.

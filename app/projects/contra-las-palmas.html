Project documentation: proposal for projection set-up<br>
<br>
As a part of the scenography of this edition of COИTRA, I developed a concept that lead to (the screening of) a short film and a live VJ set. In collaboration with Maldonado Film and Steginga Visuals the developed aesthetic was translated to different media spread out through the venue.<br>
After having studied each booked performing artists I assigned each one of them a set of artistic parameters that eventually lead to a library of excerpts from different kinds of motion pictures.<br>
The library was used to create five sequences referring to cinematography as well as complementing each artist's unique sound. The sequences were displayed in a hidden lounge area as well as alongside the corridor that hugged the actual dance floor.<br>



The library was used to create five sequences to announcing and promote performing artists Redshape, Fur Coat, Dekmantel Soundsystem, Lake People and Nino&Frankie. The sequences 


referring to cinematography as well as complementing each artist's unique sound. The sequences were displayed in a hidden lounge area as well as alongside the corridor that hugged the actual dance floor.<br>

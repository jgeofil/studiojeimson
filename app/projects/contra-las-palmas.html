<br>
As a part of the scenography of this edition of COИTRA, I developed a concept that lead to (the screening of) a short film and a live VJ set. In collaboration with Maldonado Film and Steginga Visuals the developed aesthetic was translated to different media spread out through the venue.<br>
&emsp;After having studied each booked performing artists, I assigned each one of them a set of artistic parameters that eventually lead to a library of excerpts from different kinds of motion pictures.<br>
<br>
This library was used to create a short film consisting of five composited sequences to announce and promote performing artists Redshape, Fur Coat, Dekmantel Soundsystem, Lake People and Nino&Frankie.<br>
On the night of the event the short film was screened in Las Palmas' lounge area as well as alongside the venue's dancefloor.<br>
<br>
The main objective in adding to this event's scenography was to create a cohesive and cross-medial visual language. In order to accomplish this the developed aesthetic found it's second application in live visuals.<br>
I created a library of 60 clips for Steginga Visuals to work with in creating his live set. Working with a a display system consisting of 16LED panels (2x8m) he delivered an awesome set that gave each individual performing artist it's unique set of visual characteristics.

Apart from my addition to the scenography of this event it showcased a light sculpture by Russian conceptual and visual artist Ksenija Pankratova and technology expert Vladimir Grafov. The next video shows their beautiful work and offers a glimpse into the atmosphere of COИTRA in Las Palmas.

Since I've started VJing mid 2014 (initially to expand SEKOIA's visual identity with a live performance) I've been
thinking a lot about what I would want my sets to be like. I like to see this as an ongoing study with constantly changing content and experiments with software as well as hardware.<br>
The following clips show documentation of my latest experiments.<br>
<br>
Drawing inspiration from theorists like Henry Jenkins, Clay Shirky, Jaron Lanier, Geert Lovink and artists LIL
INTERNET and Ryoji Ikeda, DJ Girltalk and the documentary RIP: A Remix Manifesto, I will continue to explore the
combination of performance: video + audio + venue + crowd chemistry from a media critical perspective for
many years to come.<br>
<br>
In 2014 and 2015 I've worked with several styles and display systems alongside i.a. DJ's: Dave DK, Redshape, Lake People, Fur Coat, Leon Vynehall,
Hunee, Jovonn, Young Marco, Dauwd, Nick Monaco, Dekmantel Soundsystem,
William Kouam Djoko, Interstellar Funk, Sirens of Saturn, Polynation, Nino&Frankie,
Tim Hoeben, Reza Athar, Florinsz Janvier, Will Oirson, Vela Uniform<br>

Since I've started VJing mid 2014 (initially to expand SEKOIA's visual identity with a live performance) I've been thinking a lot about what I would want my sets to be like. I like to see this as an ongoing study.<br>
Where initially I approached the platform from a branding perspective.. more and more I'm beginning to see possibilities for a cross-over that could show my love for contemporary visual culture and it's networked images while supporting DJ sets and contributing to the visual atmosphere of a room.

Drawing inspiration from theorists like Henry Jenkins, Clay Shirky, Jaron Lanier, Geert Lovink and artists LIL INTERNET and Ryoji Ikeda, DJ Girltalk and the documentary RIP: A Remix Manifesto, I hope to explore the combination of performance: video + audio + venue + crowd chemistry from a media critical perspective for many years to come.<br>

Forward thinking electronic music, art & culture. This is COИTRA. A young established event well known for it's adventurous spirit. Collaborating with a wide range of different artists and always on the lookout for inspiring venues, COИTRA strives to be at the forefront of the dance scene.<br>
<br>
Aside from progressive programming, NFJ Productions invests in aspiring young talents and creates multiple events in and around Rotterdam on unusual locations, engaging and sometimes defying the municipality and other creative producers in the field. Over the last year I've worked with NFJ behind the scenes as well as a performing artist.

The artwork I created for last summer's weekend edition of COИTRA translated to an online and offline campaign, announcing and engaging the local and national public domain.<br>
Aside from this campaign I performed a VJ set on the first day's afterparty at BAR Rotterdam alongside Dauwd, Nick Monaco, Nino&Frankie and Jamie Lie A Kwie.

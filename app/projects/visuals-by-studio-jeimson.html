The visual language of VJ-ing develops very slowly and often reveals more about
tools and technology than the considerations and convictions of the VJ.
As a reaction to this, Club compositing is a call for a less conventional, less
technology-driven approach to designing the physical space in which electronic
music is experienced.
By exploring a wide range of subjects and different techniques in image production,
 I try to push the medium and challenge the expectations of my audiences.
My work is inspired by what I’ve learned by studying the rich history of rave culture.
And it is highly influenced by my facination with networked visual culture.
 In terms of design, it is inspired by cinematography, graphic design, and progressive/ experimental
  styles in video compositing.<br>
<br>
My set is fuelled by media content that cuts through time. It re-contextualises
documentary video footage that shows the subculture of Gabbers - the 80’s and 90’s
 subculture that played an essential role in the development of rave culture.
It shows several adaptations of media content that exists in the online archives of
the blogosphere. And  finally my set shows a mixture of footage created using 3D
software and footage I’ve created manually by corrupting both digital and analog
video signals, using my own hardware.<br>

By bringing together these different types of content and techniques I try to bring
something new and unexpected to the medium that is the club-screen.
To create a series of moving images that is de ned by the subjects it shows, the
times and spaces it references and how this series of moving images is composited and designed.
Instead of presenting a technology
that seems to celebrate itself, I believe we should always have technology be serviceable to our human experience and expression.

Since I've started VJing mid 2014 (initially to expand SEKOIA's visual identity with a live performance) I've been thinking a lot about what I would want my sets to be like. I like to see this as an ongoing study.<br>
Where initially I approached the platform from a branding perspective.. more and more I'm beginning to see possibilities for a cross over that could show my love for contemporary visual culture and it's networked images while supporting DJsets and contributing to the visual atmosphere of a room.

Drawing inspiration from theorists like Henry Jenkins, Clay Shirky, Jaron Lanier, Geert Lovink and artists LIL INTERNET and Ryoji Ikeda, DJ Girltalk and the documentary RIP: A Remix Manifesto, I hope to explore the combination of performance: video + audio + venue + crowd chemistry from a media critical perspective for many years to come.<br>

In early april I received a folder with a bunch of pictures of Klub Kompass (Ghent,
Belgium). And I was briefed to maybe use some artist pictures to announce the first
edition of this very special travelling a/v event. Since I had just finished writing
the brand book for Bacchanale, my head was still overflowing with ideas about the
‘practice’ of partying. What elements or ingredients are needed to create a space
for people to vibe in, for people to open up their minds, connect to the physical
environment, the performing artists and each other? How do you design the space in
which electronic music is experienced? How can you reference or illustrate this in
a short video? What’s a video anyway actually?<br>
<br>
I ran a couple pictures of Klub Kompass through google’s visually similar images
search tool; a combination of several algorithms is used to reverse search an
uploaded image by mapping out its technical and visual properties and matching
these with content from a database of categorized media.<br>

<span class=white>Computer vision and representation</span><br>
An image manifests somewhere in the space that is outlined by the following four
aspects: First, the agency/ capacity of a person or object to present itself. Second, the
choices that are made by the person documenting. Third, the possibilities and limitations
of the tools and/or technology that is used in the act of documenting. And finally,
 seeing and interpeting information. Or rather: how our vision interweaves with the
  things we are programmed and tought to know and believe.
<br>
By using the visually similar images search tool of Yandex (Russia’s most popular
search engine). I’ve attempted to expose the choices and technology that are embedded
 in the pictures of 5 performing artists that are on the lineup of Vision’s first event.<br>
<br>
Something interesting that stood out in the process of this project is the differences between
Yandex and Google Image search. Google recognised my subjects. This disrupted how I was looking
to find more content based primarily on visual characteristics, similarities. Only two weeks after
having published the trailer did I realise how Yandex’ search results revealed how the engine itself
is Russian (I invite you to have a second look considering this). I can’t wait to further develop
this first step into exploring machine learning algorithms like these and how they relate to the concept of representation.

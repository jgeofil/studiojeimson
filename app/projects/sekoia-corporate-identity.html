As a renowned online platform, SEKOIA has been connecting fans of deep electronic music around the world to quality music, artists and labels. Based in the Netherlands, SEKOIA has been using its online and offline channels to spread the word about all the great music out there. Through our daily sharing of tracks, our monthly podcast, our contribution to the Dutch edition of DJMAG and our hosting of events throughout the Netherlands.

As a part of this restyling I've created four different motion graphics that explore and expand the original logo. Aside from these graphics, I delivered a refurbished, new version of the original logo along with designs for all other online platforms where the identity is currently presented: i.a. Youtube videos, podcasts, soundcloud podcasts and promotional products.<br>

In the process of working on SEKOIA's refurbished logotype I've worked on a couple of different proposals to really get familiar with the old logo and its potential for growth. References to astrology and physics and a game of typography eventually led to my first proposal, which is shown in the video posted below.
After long consideration we ended up further developing something that was closer to the original logotype. Still, the detour was an exciting and interesting process that shows alternate possibilities.

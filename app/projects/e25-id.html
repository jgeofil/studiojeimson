Hidden in the industrial West of Amsterdam lies a dark and legendary street,
home to one of the most influential party locations of the Netherlands:
The Warehouse Elementenstraat. Its industrial halls already wrote music history
in the beginning of the 90’s, when some of the first bigger-scale house raves
called ‘Multigroove’ set a milestone in the Dutch underground scene.
</p>

<p>
Around 20 years later, in 2012, the location was re-discovered by GZG, a young
collaboration of local Techno artists. Since then, the location has been opened
several times and came alive again; in order to write a second chapter of music
history.

For the Warehouse Elementstraat, I developed a members only passport with which
passport holders can collect stamps every time they visit the club.
</p>

<p>
The personal E25 ID has several functions. For one, it grants its owner
exclusive acces to hidden areas on special occasions. As members collect stamps
of third party party institutions like L.E.T. Les Enfants Terribles, REAKTOR
Events, O.W.A.P. and Welcome to the Future, the value of the passport increases,
unlocking acces to more, more and more fun.

<p>
An exciting project. As it shows a progressive way of pursuing identification
from customer to project/ brand or in this case I would say experience. The
Warehouse Elementstraat made way for pushing the envelope with a traditional
medium, reviewing and expanding it's function in a playful way, regarding the
potential of several techniques in print and binding. Complementary to this, I
found the drive to create a narrative to be very inspiring.
</p>

<p>
Printing house Tripiti Rotterdam did an amazing job on executing the design I
made using foil stamping, metallic inks and getting the outlook and feel of the
ID's cover just right, making the product a true ambassador for the Warehouse
Elementstraat and contributing third parties.

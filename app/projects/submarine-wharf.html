The Submarine Wharf is an extraordinary cultural space based on an industrial site in the harbour of Rotterdam. The exhibitions held at this space use and transform it's outspoken industrial character. In this way the SMW is an addition to the cultural landscape in which the museum way too often is nothing more than a sterile anonymous white cube. With this project I've researched in what way an Identity can complement, contribute to and emphasise the idea of using space as a canvas.

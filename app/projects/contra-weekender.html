Forward thinking electronic music, art & culture. This is COИTRA. A young established event well known for it's adventurous spirit. Collaborating with a wide range of different artists and always on the lookout for inspiring venues, COИTRA strives to be at the forefront of the dance scene.<br>
<br>
Aside from progressive programming, NFJ Productions invests in aspiring young talents and creates multiple events in and around Rotterdam on unusual locations, engaging and sometimes defying the municipality and other creative producers in the field. Over the last year I've worked with NFJ behind the scenes as well as a performing artist.

The artwork I created for last summer's weekend edition of CONTRA translated to an online and offline campaign, announcing and engaging the local and national public domain.<br>
Aside from this campaign I perfromed a VJ set on the first day's afterparty at BAR Rotterdam alongside Dauwd, Nick Monaco, Nino&Frankie and Jamie Lie A Kwie.

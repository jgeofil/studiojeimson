<br>
Agora Phobia is a unique play which is performed in public space. The viewer is surrounded by actors, machines and live music as part of this experience. In the play, the public gradually becomes a part of a transforming construction site in which a conflict concerning city planning takes place.<br>
<br>
As the story deals with tension between stakeholders with different levels of authority, I've created an image that shows a collision of perspectives. Experimenting with angles and ratio resulted in a game of scale, geometry, lighting and optical illusion.

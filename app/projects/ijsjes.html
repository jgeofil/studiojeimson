IJSJES #08 w/ Mr. Niceguy - DIN A6 Flyer and stickers (print)
<br>
<br>
Together with colleague graphic designers and friends Daan Kemp and Stefan van Rijn, I've been hosting bi-monthly club night IJSJES at BAR Rotterdam in 2013/14.
With these nights we strived to give local upcoming and more established dj's a stage within a frame of bold, open and playful design.
<br>
We formed a peculiar trinity of art directing, dj-ing, more classical, less classical and also spatial design.<br>
From love for partying, creativity and BAR Rotterdam. It has resulted in inspiring collaborations and awesome club nights!<br>

In addition to online and offline promotional campaigns, IJSJES mission statement translates to physical and interactive media. For example our handmade goodiebags. This item is used primarily to show our friends we love them for enabling and contributing to IJSJES by giving them amazing goodies when they head back home. Secondarily the goodiebag is a platform we use to promote local initiatives and the dj's we collaborate with.<br>
<br>
From discount cards to the local gay spa, delicious turkish delicacies, free lube, coffee vouchers, education on drug use and beautiful second hand toys, our goodiebag never ceased to surprise ❤

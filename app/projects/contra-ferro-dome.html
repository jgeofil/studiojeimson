On the second day of Christmas 2014 COИTRA officially opened one of Rotterdam's new event locations: the Ferro Dome. This blue gasometer and it's surrounding industrial area -that had recently been made available for cultural production and business events by the municipality of Rotterdam- presented itself as the ultimate opportunity to go all out.<br>

Guidelines for Aesthetics in Media Production:
<br>
In early conversations exploring how to make full use of this new venue's potential I felt it was time to create a document that would guide and safekeep the quality of any type of creative production carried out by and for NFJ Productions.<br>
<br>
Excerpt from intro: "The Identity Style Guide contains guidelines that should be used in the development of (media) products for Rotterdam based party society COИTRA. It is best described as an extension of COИTRA's visual identity. It should be used to validate COИTRA's visual communication in every form. In this way it focusses on aesthetics rather than branding and marketing even though it contributes to both."<br>
<br>
Excerpt from recommendation: In order to obtain and sustain recognisability, consistency is key. Promotional products, for example a Facebook header or a printed flyer that are created in order to inform, should always be clear, legible, professionally executed but still embody COИTRA's core values and contain its specific visual characteristics. However, these characteristics range from having a functional quality to having a less informative and practical quality (for example applications like live visuals, art installation or performance). Consistency in copywriting (tone of voice), usage of imagery, color and typography help sustain recognisability and reinforce COИTRA's identity. The ultimate goal is to push the boundaries of each specific medium while respecting the guidelines of this document.<br>
This enables COИTRA to sustain one of it's core values: to be innovative. To be progressive and experimental in programming and production while maintaining a strong, bold visual language."
<br>
<br>
The Identity Style Guide establishes COИTRA's core values, it's tone of voice and target group, it's products be it physical or in the form of experience design and parameters by which all creative products can be validated.<br>

In line with the Identity Style Guide, NFJ cordially invited it's friends, family and colleagues by sending out a physical guests only mailing. The design I created is in line with the event's teaser and functions as a gesture as well as an announcement showing COИTRA is excited about taking on such an exclusive event location.

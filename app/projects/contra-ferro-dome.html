On the second day of Christmas '14 CONTRA officially opened one of Rotterdam's new event locations: the Ferro Dome. This blue gasometer and it's surrounding industrial area that -had recently been made available for cultural production and business events by the municipality of Rotterdam- presented itself as the ultimate opportunity to go all out.<br>

Guidelines for Aesthetics in Media Production:
<br>
In early conversations exploring how to make full use of this new venue's potential I felt it was time to create a document that would guide and safekeep the quality of any type of creative production carried out by and for NFJ Productions.<br>
<br>
Excerpt from intro: "The Identity Style Guide contains guidelines that should be used in the development of (media) products for Rotterdam based party society CONTRA. It is best described as an extension of Contra's visual identity. It should be used to validate Contra's visual communication in every form. In this way it focusses on aesthetics rather than branding and marketing eventhough it contributes to both."<br>
<br>
Excerpt from recommendation: In order to obtain and sustain recognisibility, consistancy is key. Promotional products, for example a facebook header or a printed flyer that are created in order to inform, should always be clear, legible, profession- aly excecuted but still embody Contra's core values and contain it's specif- ic visual characteristics. However, these characteristics range from having a functional quality to having a less informative and practical quality (for example applications like live visuals, art insallation or performance). Consistancy in copywriting (tone of voice), usage of imagery, color and typography help sustain rec- ognisability and reinforce Contra's identity. The ultimate goal is to push the boundaries of each specific medium while respecting the guidelines of this document.<br>
This enables Contra to sustain one of it's core values: to be innovative. To be progressive and experimental in programming and production while maintaining a strong, bold visual language."
<br>
<br>
The Identity Style Guide establishes CONTRA's core values, it's tone of voice and target group, it's products be it physical or in the form of experience design and parameters by which all creative products can be validated.<br>

In line with the Identity Style Guide, NFJ cordially invited it's friends, familly and colleagues by sending out a physical guests only mailing. The design I created is in line with the event's teaser and functions as a gesture as well as an announcement showing CONTRA is excited about taking on such an exclusive event location.

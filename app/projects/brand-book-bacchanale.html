The Brand Book is a 30 pgs digital and physical file that is developed to inspire
the team and brief everybody working with the brand. It presents the company’s
  origin and history, vision, mission, core values, messages and (target) audiences. And it
  provides guidelines that are to be used to translate all of the above to Bacchanale's tone of voice and the visual
   characteristics of the media content produced by the brand.<br>
   <br>
   It is based on Bacchanale’s business plan, previous presentation
    files, and an analysis all of the brand’s past (visual) communication. It
    presents new strategic advice and the results of a survey that was conducted
    with the founders of the brand. It is best described as an extension of the
    company’s identity, that guides how the brand will evolve in the future.<br>

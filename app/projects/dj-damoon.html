<br>
Damoon was born in the Dutch city of Rotterdam in an artistic Persian family. Afterwards he grew up in Italy and lived in Spain. A multicultural life that brought him much of his musical openness.<br>
<br>
He journeyed through the music of such great artists as Verdi, Dean Martin, Earth Wind & Fire, Prince, Paolo Conte, the Wu-Tang Clan, Kerri Chandler, Green Velvet, Soil & Pimp Sessions, Fela Kuti and Ricardo Villalobos. All this helped along his development and lead to become a genuinely high-quality eclectic musical connaisseur.<br>
<br>
Sexy tunes and a fun loving vibe. From house to hip hop, from funk to techno, from future beats to jazz and more. Damoon kicks every beat up with soulful flair and ambitiously touches audiences at their core.<br>

As Damoon is a performer with a wide range of musical styles, versatility is one of the main elements that shape the visual identity.
Keeping in mind though that every single medium has a specific function, it shows a selection of the core values -as illustrated in the identity style guide- rather than all at once.<br>
For example: where a business card should communicate more of a feeling, a website should be more informative and functional. The logotype is the main consistent element that ties together different more versatile media, using a wide range of images that refer to Damoon's colorful and playful sound.<br>

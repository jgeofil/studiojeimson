Inanimate Life on Tumblr is an ongoing research that explores and visualizes the journey of a specific photograph through the
network of blogging platform Tumblr. A year after publishing, this picture has collected an amount of 6317 notes (reposts and likes).
The video posted above shows one of earlier tests to determine the most suitable way to present collected data.
The video posted below shows the first complete presentation of data collected over a period of three months.<br>
<br>
An interesting result of this research is that it shows different subcultures within Tumblr's network of users/
media producers engage with a specific image. Their adaptation of the image reveals it's countless intrinsic, connotative and visual characteristics.<br>
As the image spreads through all kinds of different online contexts its meaning multiplies and is broken down
into over six thousand new pieces continuously expanding and changing it's meaning.

The most recently published video shows five categories or genres within the network of photo-blogs that
stood out of my dataset. The categories show an outspoken aesthetic and a collection of visual parameters <br>
that define the look of distributed imagery and their contexts within other photo-blogs. Hugged by an interface-
like frame that chronologically displays the subject image's notes (reposts and likes), the five different
categories are presented by different sequences of imagery.
<br>
<br>
Hashtags like #tonsurton, #low-saturation and #low-contrast define the subject image's visual characteristics.
Hashtags like #interior, #sanitary, #modern, #artificial and #hospital define its connotative characteristics.
Depending on each individual image's visual and connotative characteristics, the sequences
relate to those of the subject image revealing similarities and differences.<br>
<br>
As the amount of the subject image's notes keeps increasing, I continue following it and learning about its expanding context and online life.

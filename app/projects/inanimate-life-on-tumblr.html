Inanimate Life on Tumblr is the first of a series of videos that follow the journey of a photograph through the network of TUmblr.
The visual language I developed for the corporate identity of a new club night in Rotterdam shows my
fascination and appreciation of online visual culture and the networked image. It celebrates the internet's low
resolution images rather then discriminating against then.
The idea of the traditional poster displaying a screenshot-like image plays on the differences and similarities
between static and interactive media.

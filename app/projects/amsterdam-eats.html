Amsterdam, city of food and music, welcomes a fresh food festival experience!
<br>
In October the Warehouse Elementenstraat opens it's doors for Amsterdam's first organic indoor food festival.
Combining culinary delicacies with drinks and deep house music into a one of a kind happening, Amsterdam Eats is for everyone: a daylight filled indoor location with a familiar atmosphere, suitable for all kinds of friends and family happenings.<br>
<br>
In developing the visual language for Amsterdam Eats I've experimented with more and less abstract references to the joys of eating and working with food as ingredients and material. Using a physical set up to play around with scale, lighting, and the actual subjects made way for a one of a kind aesthetic.

Void is a club-night held at Subsonic, Groningen, which is all about raw, deep and underground techno from Detroit to Berlin.

The identity I developed for this event is based on a self proclaimed "from Tsjernobyl with love" kind of vibe. Raw grainy industrial imagery mixed with flashy romantic typography. In order to make the type pop it has been applied using stencils and spray-paint.

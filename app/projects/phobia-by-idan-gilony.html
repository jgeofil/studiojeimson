Gilony's collection is inspired by transition, transformation and high contrasts. In his work he plays with themes like i.a. androgyny, gender and darkness. I started this project by looking for an idea or form that communicates the specific tension that characterises Gilony's couture. It had to be something uncanny. A shape that could be viewed from different perspectives while remaining recognisable in what it represents.<br>
<br>
I found the möbius strip to be a very inspiring shape that can be used in a lot of different applications.

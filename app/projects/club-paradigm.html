In the design I made for underground day- and nightclub Paradigm I focussed on translating the ambience of the club to a functional but original website.
By taking pictures of different types of texturised paper and digitally manipulating them, I created a set of background images that refer to the grainy distorted industrial feel of the club. As the vibe of the annual festival is much lighter and brighter, the pages that give information about this event are displayed in a light version of the website.<br>
<br>
The home page shows an archive of blog items (about .e.g., upcoming events and interviews with collaborating dj's), the agenda and a banner for the next big event. There's image galleries, after movies, integrated ticketscript stuff, and everything you need to know about this awesome venue, it's past and it's future.<br>

With the finalisation of the design of the site, I delivered an identity style guide that has been used in the development of other products (by other designers) such as the website for Paradigm's Booking Agency <a href="http://www.paradigmbookings.com/" target="_blank">Paradigmbookings.com</a> and other print products.
